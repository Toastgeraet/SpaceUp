# Active Context: SpaceTraders.io Management Interface

## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: Initial Setup Phase
- **Phase**: Memory Bank Initialization
- **Goal**: Establish comprehensive project documentation and technical foundation
- **Priority**: Complete memory bank setup before beginning implementation

### Current Session Activities
1. ‚úÖ Created project brief with comprehensive requirements
2. ‚úÖ Defined product context and user experience goals
3. ‚úÖ Documented system architecture patterns and technical decisions
4. ‚úÖ Established technology stack and development constraints
5. üîÑ Completing memory bank initialization
6. ‚è∏Ô∏è Pending: Implementation planning and first development steps

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Establishment
- **projectbrief.md**: Comprehensive project overview with phased implementation approach
- **productContext.md**: User-centered design philosophy and experience goals
- **systemPatterns.md**: Dual-mode architecture with client/server automation support
- **techContext.md**: Modern React/TypeScript stack with emphasis on rate limiting

### Key Insights Captured
- SpaceTraders.io is a headless API-only game requiring full UI development
- Rate limiting is critical (2 req/sec burst, 10 req/10sec sustained)
- Dual-mode architecture enables both browser and server-based automation
- Visual workflow editor similar to n8n/Node-RED for automation building

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Complete Memory Bank**: Finish progress.md and suggestions files
2. **API Research**: Examine SpaceTraders.io API documentation in detail
3. **Quickstart Analysis**: Review all 6 quickstart guide pages for implementation requirements
4. **Technical Planning**: Create detailed implementation roadmap

### Implementation Sequence
1. **Foundation Setup**:
   - Initialize React/TypeScript project with Vite
   - Set up basic project structure and development environment
   - Implement core API client with rate limiting

2. **Authentication & Basic UI**:
   - Token input and validation system
   - Agent selection/creation interface
   - Basic dashboard layout

3. **Quickstart Implementation**:
   - Follow 6-step quickstart guide
   - Create UI for each step
   - Test complete tutorial flow

4. **Automation Foundation**:
   - Visual workflow editor setup
   - Basic node types (actions, conditions, loops)
   - Client-side execution engine

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Choices Made
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript for type safety and maintainability
- **State Management**: Zustand for simpler state management over Redux
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid development and consistency
- **Workflow Editor**: React Flow for node-based automation builder
- **Rate Limiting**: Custom implementation to precisely match API requirements

### Pending Technical Decisions
- **Server Architecture**: Express vs Fastify for optional server mode
- **Database Choice**: SQLite for simplicity vs PostgreSQL for robustness
- **Real-time Strategy**: Polling vs WebSocket for live updates
- **Testing Framework**: Specific testing approach for automation workflows

### User Experience Priorities
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with simple manual controls, add automation complexity gradually
- **Mobile-First**: Ensure core functionality works well on mobile devices
- **Rate Limit Transparency**: Show users current rate limit status and queue
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of API errors and network issues

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization Patterns
- **Feature-Based Structure**: Group by domain (authentication, automation, dashboard) rather than type
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulate API interactions and state management
- **Component Composition**: Prefer composition over inheritance for UI flexibility
- **Type-First Development**: Define TypeScript interfaces before implementation

### API Integration Patterns
- **Request Queue**: All API calls go through centralized queue system
- **Optimistic Updates**: Update UI immediately, rollback on errors
- **Cache Strategy**: Intelligent caching based on data mutation frequency
- **Error Boundaries**: Contain errors at component level with fallback UI

### Automation Design Patterns
- **Node-Based Architecture**: Each action/condition as separate, composable node
- **Event-Driven Execution**: Workflows react to game state changes
- **Visual Programming**: Minimize code writing, maximize visual configuration
- **Runtime Abstraction**: Same workflow definition runs in client or server mode

## Project Insights and Learnings

### SpaceTraders.io Understanding
- Game is entirely API-driven with no official UI
- Player progression follows space exploration and trading mechanics
- Automation is key to efficient resource gathering and management
- Community likely consists of technically-minded players

### Market Opportunity
- Large gap between API complexity and user accessibility
- Mobile companion app could significantly expand user base
- Visual automation tools could attract non-technical players
- PWA approach enables full-featured mobile experience

### Technical Challenges Identified
- Rate limiting requires sophisticated queue management
- Real-time updates need careful balance with API constraints
- Browser limitations may require creative background processing solutions
- Dual-mode architecture adds complexity but provides essential flexibility

## Current Blockers and Risks

### Technical Risks
- **Rate Limiting Complexity**: Underestimating rate limit management could break user experience
- **Browser Limitations**: Background processing constraints may limit automation effectiveness
- **API Stability**: Dependency on external API without SLA guarantees

### Project Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Feature-rich automation system could delay basic functionality
- **User Adoption**: Technical barriers may still exist despite UI improvements
- **Maintenance Burden**: Dual-mode architecture increases complexity and maintenance overhead

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Phased Development**: Implement basic features first, add complexity gradually
- **API Abstraction**: Build robust API client to isolate application from API changes
- **User Testing**: Early testing with actual SpaceTraders.io players
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation to reduce maintenance burden
