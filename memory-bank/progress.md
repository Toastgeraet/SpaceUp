#### Phase 4: PWA Excellence and Advanced Features (Long-term)
- [ ] **PWA Optimization**
  - [ ] Advanced service worker features
  - [ ] App manifest and installation prompts
  - [ ] Background fetch for large data sets
  - [ ] Periodic background sync

- [ ] **Analytics and Visualization with Offline Support**
  - [ ] Performance dashboards with local data aggregation

## Known Issues and Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- **Rate Limiting Complexity**: Need sophisticated queue management to handle burst vs sustained limits
- **Real-time Updates**: Balancing live data with API rate constraints
- **Cross-Origin Requests**: May need proxy or CORS configuration for API calls
- **Background Processing**: Browser tab lifecycle limitations for automation

### Design Challenges
- **Information Density**: Displaying complex game state without overwhelming users
- **Mobile Interface**: Fitting comprehensive controls into mobile screens
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of automation status and API rate limits
- **Error Communication**: User-friendly error messages for API failures

### API Dependencies
- **External API Reliability**: No SLA guarantees from SpaceTraders.io
- **API Changes**: Potential breaking changes in API without notice
- **Rate Limit Variations**: Possible changes to rate limiting rules
- **Response Time Variability**: API performance may affect user experience

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Evolution Decisions
- **Framework Migration**: Vue 3 chosen over React for better PWA integration and reactivity
- **State Management**: Pinia selected for Vue 3 ecosystem and offline-first patterns
- **Offline-First Priority**: IndexedDB and service workers as foundation, not afterthought
- **Styling Approach**: Tailwind CSS retained for rapid development and consistency
- **Build Tool**: Vite chosen for excellent Vue 3 and PWA support

### Design Philosophy Evolution
- **Offline-First**: Application works without internet, enhances when connected
- **Local-First Data**: All state changes happen locally first, sync in background
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Perfect offline experience, better when online
- **Mobile-First PWA**: True mobile app experience with offline gaming capability
- **Visual Programming**: Minimize code writing for automation with Vue 3 reactivity
- **Dual-Mode Architecture**: Client and server execution built on offline-first foundation

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Phased Development**: Reduce risk by delivering value incrementally
- **API Abstraction**: Isolate application from API changes
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Ensure reliability despite external dependencies
- **User-Centered Design**: Regular testing with actual players
