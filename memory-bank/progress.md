## Known Issues and Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- **Rate Limiting Complexity**: Need sophisticated queue management to handle burst vs sustained limits
- **Real-time Updates**: Balancing live data with API rate constraints
- **Cross-Origin Requests**: May need proxy or CORS configuration for API calls
- **Background Processing**: Browser tab lifecycle limitations for automation

### Design Challenges
- **Information Density**: Displaying complex game state without overwhelming users
- **Mobile Interface**: Fitting comprehensive controls into mobile screens
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of automation status and API rate limits
- **Error Communication**: User-friendly error messages for API failures

### API Dependencies
- **External API Reliability**: No SLA guarantees from SpaceTraders.io
- **API Changes**: Potential breaking changes in API without notice
- **Rate Limit Variations**: Possible changes to rate limiting rules
- **Response Time Variability**: API performance may affect user experience

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Architecture Decisions
- **Framework Choice**: React chosen for ecosystem and component reusability
- **State Management**: Zustand selected over Redux for simplicity
- **Styling Approach**: Tailwind CSS for rapid development and consistency
- **Build Tool**: Vite chosen for fast development experience

### Design Philosophy Evolution
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
- **Mobile-First**: Recognize mobile usage will be significant
- **Visual Programming**: Minimize code writing for automation
- **Dual-Mode Architecture**: Support both client and server execution

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Phased Development**: Reduce risk by delivering value incrementally
- **API Abstraction**: Isolate application from API changes
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Ensure reliability despite external dependencies
- **User-Centered Design**: Regular testing with actual players

## Success Metrics and Goals

### Development Milestones
- **Week 2**: Working API client with rate limiting
- **Week 4**: Complete quickstart guide implementation
- **Week 8**: Basic automation workflows functional
- **Week 12**: PWA ready and full feature set

### User Experience Goals
- **Onboarding Time**: <10 minutes to complete quickstart tutorial
- **Daily Usage**: <2 minutes to check status and make decisions on mobile
- **Automation Setup**: <5 minutes to create basic mining routine
- **Error Recovery**: <30 seconds to understand and resolve most issues

### Technical Performance Goals
- **API Response Time**: <500ms for cached requests
- **UI Responsiveness**: <100ms for user interactions
- **Bundle Size**: <500KB initial load
- **Mobile Performance**: 60fps on mid-range devices
