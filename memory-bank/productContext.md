# Product Context: SpaceTraders.io Management Interface

## Why This Project Exists

SpaceTraders.io is a headless space 4x game that operates purely through API calls, lacking a user-friendly interface. Players must interact with the game through raw API requests, creating barriers to entry and limiting the gameplay experience. This management interface bridges that gap by providing:

1. **Accessibility**: Makes the game playable for users who aren't comfortable with direct API interaction
2. **Efficiency**: Reduces manual repetitive tasks through automation
3. **Visualization**: Transforms raw data into meaningful visual representations
4. **Mobile Access**: Enables gameplay on mobile devices through PWA functionality

## Problems We Solve

### Primary Pain Points
- **High Technical Barrier**: Players need API knowledge to play effectively
- **Manual Repetition**: Many game actions require repetitive API calls
- **Data Overload**: Raw API responses are difficult to parse and understand
- **Limited Accessibility**: No mobile-friendly interface for on-the-go management
- **Offline Limitations**: Game progress stops when browser is closed

### User Scenarios
1. **New Player**: Wants to learn the game without learning API documentation
2. **Casual Player**: Wants to check game status and make decisions on mobile
3. **Advanced Player**: Wants to set up automation routines for resource gathering
4. **Remote Player**: Wants agents to continue working while away from computer

## How It Should Work

### Core User Flow
1. **Authentication**: Simple token input with validation
2. **Dashboard**: Overview of agent status, resources, and active missions
3. **Manual Controls**: Point-and-click interface for all game actions
4. **Automation Builder**: Visual workflow editor for creating agent routines
5. **Mobile Companion**: PWA for monitoring and basic controls

### Key Interactions
- **Drag-and-Drop Automation**: Users create workflows by connecting action nodes
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live data refresh with rate-limiting awareness
- **Context-Aware UI**: Interface adapts based on current game state and available actions
- **Notification System**: Alerts for completed actions, errors, or opportunities

## User Experience Goals

### Usability Principles
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, reveal complexity as needed
- **Immediate Feedback**: Clear indication of action results and system state
- **Error Prevention**: Validate actions before execution, warn of consequences
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, mobile-friendly

### Target User Experience
1. **Onboarding**: Complete quickstart tutorial through UI in under 10 minutes
2. **Daily Use**: Check status and make decisions in under 2 minutes on mobile
3. **Automation Setup**: Create basic mining routine in under 5 minutes
4. **Advanced Workflows**: Build complex multi-step automation without coding

### Success Metrics
- Time to complete quickstart tutorial (target: <10 minutes)
- User retention after first week (target: >70%)
- Automation adoption rate (target: >50% of active users)
- Mobile usage percentage (target: >30% of sessions)

## Competitive Advantages
- **Official API Integration**: Direct, reliable connection to game systems
- **Dual-Mode Architecture**: Both browser-based and server-based automation
- **Low-Code Approach**: Visual automation without programming knowledge
- **Mobile-First PWA**: Full functionality on mobile devices
- **Open Architecture**: Extensible for community contributions

## Long-term Vision
Transform SpaceTraders.io from a developer-focused API game into an accessible, engaging 4x strategy game with powerful automation capabilities, serving both casual mobile users and hardcore automation enthusiasts.
